1. Flask: Flask is the main dependency that will be shared across all the files. It is a micro web framework written in Python.

2. Image Endpoint: This is the API endpoint that will be used to generate images. It will be defined in the main.py file and used in the templates/index.html file for making API calls.

3. Prompt: This is a string parameter that will be passed to the image endpoint. It will be used in the main.py file for defining the API and in the templates/index.html file for passing the parameter value.

4. Diffusion API: This is the API that will be used to generate images. It will be defined in the api/diffusion.py file and used in the main.py file for generating images.

5. Image URL: This is the URL of the generated image. It will be returned by the image endpoint in the main.py file and used in the templates/index.html file for displaying the image.

6. Static/images/: This is the directory where the generated images will be stored. It will be used in the main.py file for saving the images and in the templates/index.html file for retrieving the images.

7. Requirements.txt: This file will contain all the dependencies required for the project. It will be used by the main.py file and the api/diffusion.py file for importing the necessary modules.

8. Function Names: The function names such as 'generate_image' (for generating images using the diffusion API) and 'get_image_url' (for getting the URL of the generated image) will be shared across the main.py file and the api/diffusion.py file.
